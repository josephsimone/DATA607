## Background {#nextsteps .emphasized}

$Co$-$Orrurence$ $Grouping$ $and$ $Association$ $Discovery$ attempts to find associations between entities based on transcations involving them.

#### Why Find This?

To see if these Co-Orrurences & Associations can capture true consumer preferences,and in doing so, this may increase revenue from cross-selling. 
<center>![](C:/Users/jpsim/Documents/DATA Acquisition and Management/pairs.jpg){width=27%}


## Co-Occurrence {#nextsteps .emphasized}

<center>Co-Occurrence is simply a search through the data for combinations of items whos statistics are "interesting." 
<center>"If A occurs then B is likely to occur as well" 

## Association {#nextsteps .emphasized}

<center>Association Discovery is commonly refered to as Market Basket Analysis (MBA).

<center>The MBA helps us to understand what items are likely to be purchased together.


## Complexity Control {#nextsteps .emphasized}

#### Support of Association <br> 
- Let’s say that we require rules to apply to at least 0.01% of all transactions

#### Strength of the Rule <br>  
- Let’s say that we require that 5% or more of the time, a buyer of A also buys B
  
## Lift and Leverage: surrise measures {#nextsteps .emphasized}
* The Lift of the co-orrurrence of A and B is the probability that we actually see the two together.

* The Leavage measure the diffenece of the quantities rather than their ratio. 


## Measuring Surpise {#nextsteps .emphasized}

<center> $Lift(A,B)=\frac{p(A,B)}{p(A)*p(B)}$<br>

<center>  $Leverage(A,B)= p(B,A) - p(A)*p(B)$

## Beer and Lottery Tickters {#nextsteps .emphasized}
We operate a small convenience store where people buy groceries, liquor, lottery tickets, etc.  

#### We estimate that:

<center>30% of all transactions involve beer.

<center>![](C:/Users/jpsim/Documents/DATA Acquisition and Management/beer.jpg){ width=12.5%}

<center>40% of all transactions involve lottery.

<center>![](C:/Users/jpsim/Documents/DATA Acquisition and Management/lotto.png){ width=12.5%}

<center> 20% of all the transactions include both beer and lottery tickets.

***
## We assume: {#nextsteps .emphasized}

#### "Customers who buy beer are also likely to buy lottery tickets"


* From here we can calculate the chance that these products would be bought together(the product of the two variables). 

$p(beer) = 0.3$<br>
$p(lotterytickets) = 0.4$
```{r}
beer = 0.3
lottery_tickets = 0.4
blt  = beer * lottery_tickets
blt
```

$p(beer)*p(lotterytickets)=0.12$

## What is the Lift ? {#nextsteps .emphasized}
As mentioned before, 20% of the transaction involve both.

Therefore,
$p(lotterytickets, beer) = 0.2$

$Lift(A,B)=\frac{p(A,B)}{p(A)*p(B)}$

```{r}
pbl = 0.2
bl_lift = pbl / blt
bl_lift
```
This means that buying lottery tickets and beer together is about $1\frac{2}{3}$ times more likely

## What is the Leverage ? {#nextsteps .emphasized}

$Leverage(A,B)= p(B,A) - p(A)*p(B)$

$p(lotterytickets,beer)-p(lotterytickets)*p(beer)$
```{r}
bl_leverage = pbl - blt
bl_leverage
```

Whatever is driving the Co-Occurences result in an 8% point increase in the probability of buying both together, not just simply because we would expect them to be popular items.

## Furthermore {#nextsteps .emphasized}

#### When talking about Co-Occurrences and Associations 
##### We can also calculate two other variables : <br>
- $Support$<br>
- $Strength$

***

#### The Support of the Association is just the prevalence in the data of buying items <br>
or<br>
$p(lotterytickets, beer)$
```{r}
pbl
```

$Support =$ 20%

#### The Strength is the Conditional Probabilty, $(1 - p)$<br>
or <br>
 $(beer,lotterytickets)$  
```{r}
bl_strength = 1-blt
bl_strength
```
$Strength =$ 67%
